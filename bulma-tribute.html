        <h1>Welcome to Bulma's Tribute Page</h1>
        <p>Bulma was adopted August 2019 from Riverside shelter. I came to get a blood test for a job requirement at a hospital and happened to walk in to the shelter. I headed down one of the kennel walkways unbeknownst to me that it was the section of the shelter that housed all the sick and aggressive dogs. Bulma was listed at 7 years old when I got her with multiple masses protruding from her stomach and sides. We were lucky enough to have her in our lives for 2 years. She lived in 3 different houses with us. Moving from Highland, CA to a Western Inn motel and then a small house in Vacaville, CA. She helped tremendously in boosting confidence with our first girl Chi Chi and forever left a lasting impact in all our lives.</p>
